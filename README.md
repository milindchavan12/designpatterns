# Design Patterns

## Creational Patterns
Creational design patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

### 1. Factory Method
Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

### 2. Abstract Factory
Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

### 1. Adaptor Pattern
Adapter pattern works as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces. This type of design pattern comes under structural pattern as this pattern combines the capability of two independent interfaces.

### 2. Bridge Patterns
Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently. A Standard car and Sports car acceleration example.

### 3. Builder Pattern
Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.

### 4. Chain of Responsibility
Chain of Responsibility is a behavioral design pattern that lets you pass requests along a chain of handlers. Upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.
